abstract: Single-cell sequencing has provided profound insights into understanding
  heterogeneous cellular activities by measuring sequence information at the individual
  cell resolution. Accurately annotating a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
  dataset is a crucial step for the single-cell data analysis pipeline. In particular,
  previously unobserved cell types and cellular states frequently appear in scRNA-seq
  experiments and carry valuable information. This highlights the need for reliable
  annotation tools with out-of-distribution (OOD) detection capability. Recent advances
  in energy-based modelling have made it possible to design and deploy EBMs for joint
  discriminative and generative tasks. In this work, we introduced energy-based models
  (EBMs) for scRNA-seq annotation and investigated generative modelling for OOD detection,
  which result in more accurate, calibrated, and robust cell-type predictions. Specifically,
  we developed CLAMS, an EBM instance improved upon the previous joint energy-based
  model (JEM), for single-cell data hybrid modelling. Our experiments reveal that
  hybrid modelling with EBMs maintains the strong discriminative power of baseline
  classifiers and outperforms the state-of-the-art by integrating generative capabilities
  in data annotation and OOD detection tasks. To the best of our knowledge, we are
  the first to apply EBMs for single-cell data modelling.
