abstract: The ability to design and optimize biological sequences with specific functionalities
  would unlock enormous value in technology and healthcare. In recent years, machine
  learning-guided sequence design has progressed this goal significantly, though validating
  designed sequences in the lab or clinic takes many months and substantial labor.  It
  is therefore valuable to assess the likelihood that a designed set contains sequences
  of the desired quality (which often lies outside the label distribution in our training
  data) before committing resources to an experiment. Forecasting, a prominent concept
  in many domains where feedback can be delayed (e.g. elections), has not been used
  or studied in the context of sequence design. Here we propose a method to guide
  decision-making that forecasts the performance of high-throughput libraries (e.g.
  containing $10{^}5$ unique variants) based on estimates provided by models, providing
  a posterior for the distribution of labels in the library. We show that our method
  outperforms baselines that naively use model scores to estimate library performance,
  which are the only tool available today for this purpose.
