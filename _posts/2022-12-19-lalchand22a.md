abstract: Single-cell RNA-seq datasets are growing in size and complexity, enabling
  the study of cellular composition changes in various biological/clinical contexts.
  Scalable dimensionality reduction techniques are in need to disentangle biological
  variation in them, while accounting for technical and biological confounders. In
  this work, we extend a popular approach for probabilistic non-linear dimensionality
  reduction, the Gaussian process latent variable model, to scale to massive single-cell
  datasets while explicitly accounting for technical and biological confounders. The
  key idea is to use an augmented kernel which preserves the factorisability of the
  lower bound allowing for fast stochastic variational inference. We demonstrate its
  ability to reconstruct previously described latent signatures of innate immunity
  with 9x speed-up on training time. We further analyse a dataset of blood cells from
  COVID-19 patients and demonstrate that this framework enables to capture interpretable
  signatures of infection, while integrating data across individuals and technical
  batches. Specifically, we explore COVID-19 severity as a latent dimension to refine
  patient stratification and capture disease-specific gene expression signatures.
