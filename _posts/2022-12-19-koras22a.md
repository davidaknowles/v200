abstract: Recent emergence of high-throughput drug screening assays sparkled an intensive
  development of machine learning methods, including models for prediction of sensitivity
  of cancer cell lines to anti-cancer drugs, as well as methods for generation of
  potential drug candidates. However, the concept of generating compounds with specific
  properties and simultaneous modeling of their efficacy against cancer cell lines
  has not been comprehensively explored. To address this need, we present VADEERS,
  a Variational Autoencoder-based Drug Efficacy Estimation Recommender System. The
  generation of compounds is performed by a novel variational autoencoder with a semi-supervised
  Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior. The prior defines a clustering in the latent
  space, where the clusters are associated with specific drug properties. In addition,
  VADEERS is equipped with a cell line autoencoder and a sensitivity prediction network.
  The model combines data for SMILES string representations of anti-cancer drugs,
  their inhibition profiles against a panel of protein kinases, cell lines{’} biological
  features and measurements of the sensitivity of the cell lines to the drugs. The
  evaluated variants of VADEERS achieve a high r=0.87 Pearson correlation between
  true and predicted drug sensitivity estimates. We show that the learned latent representations
  and new generated data points accurately reflect the given clustering. In summary,
  VADEERS offers a comprehensive model of drugs{’} and cell lines{’} properties and
  relationships between them, as well as a guided generation of novel compounds.
